This is cqual, a type qualifier inference system for C.  To install cqual, run
configure and then make:

	./configure
	make

If all goes well, the makefile will build two executables in the src
directory:  cqual, the type qualifier inference system, and iquals, a
small tool for experimenting with qualifier constraints.  The makefile
will also build PAM (Program Analysis Mode for emacs) and append some
commands to your .emacs file so that you can run cqual using PAM.

See the full documentation in doc/user-guide.{ps,pdf} for, among other
things, an introductory tutorial.

This is a beta version of cqual.  See Appendix A of the documentation
for known bugs and limitations.
